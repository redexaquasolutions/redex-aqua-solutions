      <p>White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV) is a highly contagious viral infection that affects prawns and other crustaceans. It can cause rapid mortality, often leading to 100% loss within 3-10 days of the first signs of outbreak. Effective management is critical for the sustainability of any prawn farm.</p>
      <h4>Key Prevention Strategies:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Biosecurity:</strong> Implement strict biosecurity measures. This includes using bird nets, crab fencing, and disinfecting all equipment and personnel entering the farm.</li>
        <li><strong>Water Source Screening:</strong> Ensure your water source is free from WSSV carriers. Use fine mesh screens on water inlets and consider water treatment methods like chlorination/dechlorination cycles.</li>
        <li><strong>Seed Quality:</strong> Source your post-larvae (PL) from reputable, WSSV-free hatcheries. Always test a sample of PLs for WSSV before stocking.</li>
        <li><strong>Pond Preparation:</strong> Proper pond preparation, including sludge removal and disinfection, can eliminate potential virus sources from previous crops.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Management During an Outbreak:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Immediate Isolation:</strong> Isolate the infected pond immediately to prevent spread to other ponds.</li>
        <li><strong>Stress Reduction:</strong> Avoid sudden changes in water quality parameters. Use immune-stimulants like Vitamin C (found in products like C-STRENGTH) and high-quality probiotics (like NEW PROBIT) to boost the prawn's natural defenses.</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency Harvest:</strong> In many cases, an emergency harvest is the only viable option to salvage some of the stock before mass mortality occurs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Consistent monitoring and proactive management are the best defenses against WSSV. Stay vigilant and consult with aquaculture experts if you suspect an outbreak.</p>

    excerpt: 'A deep dive into maintaining ideal pH, ammonia, and oxygen levels for healthy prawn growth.',

    content: `
      <p>Water quality is the single most important factor in successful prawn farming. Poor water quality leads to stress, poor growth, disease susceptibility, and mortality. Monitoring and maintaining key parameters is essential.</p>
      <h4>1. Dissolved Oxygen (DO):</h4>
      <p>Prawns require adequate oxygen for respiration and metabolism. The ideal DO level is above 5 ppm. Low DO can be caused by overstocking, overfeeding, and algal blooms crashing. Use aerators to maintain DO levels, especially during the night. Products like REDEX FRESH TABLETS can be used to provide emergency oxygen.</p>
      <h4>2. pH:</h4>
      <p>The ideal pH range for prawn farming is between 7.5 and 8.5. Large daily fluctuations can stress the prawns. Low pH can be corrected by applying agricultural lime, while high pH (often caused by dense phytoplankton blooms) can be managed by reducing sunlight or using appropriate water treatments.</p>
      <h4>3. Ammonia:</h4>
      <p>Ammonia is toxic to prawns and is a byproduct of their waste and uneaten feed. Total Ammonia Nitrogen (TAN) should be kept below 1 ppm. The toxic form, un-ionized ammonia, increases with higher pH and temperature. Good pond management, water exchange, and the use of products like RD YUCCA and probiotics (SREE ANCHOR) can help control ammonia levels.</p>
      <h4>4. Salinity & Minerals:</h4>
      <p>Maintaining stable salinity is crucial. Additionally, ensure there are sufficient minerals like calcium and magnesium for proper molting and shell formation. Supplements like DI-CAL-P can prevent issues like soft-shelling.</p>

    title: 'Effective Feed Management Techniques',
    excerpt: 'Discover how to calculate FCR and implement feeding strategies that reduce waste and maximize growth.',

    content: `
      <p>Feed is the largest operational cost in prawn farming, so efficient feed management is key to profitability. The goal is to provide enough nutrition for maximum growth without wasting feed, which pollutes the pond.</p>
      <h4>Calculating Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR):</h4>
      <p>FCR is a measure of how efficiently feed is converted into biomass. It's calculated as: <strong>FCR = Total Feed Given / Total Weight Gain</strong>. A lower FCR is better. For example, an FCR of 1.5 means it takes 1.5 kg of feed to produce 1 kg of prawns. Monitoring FCR helps you adjust your feeding strategy.</p>
      <h4>Best Practices for Feeding:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Check Trays:</strong> Place check trays around the pond to monitor feed consumption. Check them 2-3 hours after feeding. If there's leftover feed, reduce the amount. If they are empty, you might consider a slight increase.</li>
        <li><strong>Feed According to Biomass:</strong> Regularly sample your prawns to estimate their average body weight (ABW) and total biomass. Adjust the feeding rate (as a percentage of biomass) based on the prawn's age and size.</li>
        <li><strong>Use High-Quality Feed and Binders:</strong> Ensure your feed is nutritionally complete. Use a good quality binder gel like DIAMOND GEL to coat the feed with supplements, which reduces nutrient leaching into the water.</li>
        <li><strong>Observe Prawn Behavior:</strong> Healthy, active prawns will come to the feed. Sluggish behavior can indicate stress or disease, and feeding should be reduced until the issue is resolved.</li>

    excerpt: 'A look into the causes of White Gut Syndrome and effective strategies for prevention and treatment in shrimp farming.',

    content: `
      <p>Shrimp farming, while rewarding, presents unique challenges. One common concern is the appearance of "white gut" or "white feces" in shrimp ponds, signaling underlying issues within the pond ecosystem.</p>
      <h4>What is White Gut?</h4>
      <p>White gut syndrome is characterized by shrimp excreting whitish or opaque fecal matter instead of the normal brown or black. This indicates various health and environmental problems.</p>
      <h4>Common Causes:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Poor Pond Management:</strong> Inadequate practices can stress shrimp and unbalance the ecosystem.</li>
        <li><strong>Compromised Water Quality:</strong> High levels of ammonia, nitrites, or other pollutants disrupt shrimp digestion.</li>
        <li><strong>Algal Blooms & Plankton Crash:</strong> Rapid shifts in algal populations can alter water parameters and oxygen, impacting shrimp health.</li>
        <li><strong>Poor Bottom Management:</strong> Accumulated organic matter and sludge at the pond bottom foster harmful bacteria.</li>
        <li><strong>Overfeeding:</strong> Excess, uneaten feed decomposes, pollutes the water, and can lead to gut infections if ingested by shrimp.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Effective Solutions:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Implement Proper Pond Management:</strong> Regularly monitor water quality parameters (pH, ammonia, oxygen) and ensure adequate aeration and circulation.</li>
        <li><strong>Improve Water Quality:</strong> Utilize filtration and periodic water exchange.</li>
        <li><strong>Prevent Algal Blooms:</strong> Control nutrient inputs and promote balanced ecosystem dynamics.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhance Bottom Management:</strong> Regularly remove organic debris and consider using probiotics to maintain a healthy microbial balance.</li>
        <li><strong>Practice Proper Feeding Techniques:</strong> Distribute feed in smaller, controlled portions multiple times a day to minimize waste and prevent gut infections.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
      <p>While white gut syndrome can be concerning, it is manageable with proactive and proper strategies. By prioritizing optimal water quality, sound pond management, and responsible feeding, shrimp farmers can ensure the health and well-being of their shrimp populations, leading to successful and sustainable aquaculture operations.</p>
